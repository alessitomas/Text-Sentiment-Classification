# Text-Sentiment-Classification





## Abstract
We introduce a novel approach for automatically classifying the sentiment of Twitter messages. These messages are
classified as either positive or negative with respect to a
query term. This is useful for consumers who want to research the sentiment of products before purchase, or companies that want to monitor the public sentiment of their
brands. There is no previous research on classifying sentiment of messages on microblogging services like Twitter.
We present the results of machine learning algorithms for
classifying the sentiment of Twitter messages using distant
supervision. Our training data consists of Twitter messages
with emoticons, which are used as noisy labels. This type of
training data is abundantly available and can be obtained
through automated means. We show that machine learning algorithms (Naive Bayes, Maximum Entropy, and SVM)
have accuracy above 80% when trained with emoticon data.
This paper also describes the preprocessing steps needed in
order to achieve high accuracy. The main contribution of
this paper is the idea of using tweets with emoticon
